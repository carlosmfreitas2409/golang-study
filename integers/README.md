---

## ðŸ’¡ About the lesson
In this project we have seen a bit more about the TDD workflow, integers, and also learned how to improve our documentation.

## ðŸš€ About the project
This is also a very simple project. The project has a function that takes two integers as argument and sums the two numbers. 

In addition, this function has a description and an example for documentation.
